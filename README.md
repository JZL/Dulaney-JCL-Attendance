#What is this?
This collection of scripts integrates with [google apps script](https://www.google.com/script/start/) to make a fully automated attendance system for any club (in this case, a Junior Classical League). It provides a central spreadsheet that integrates with an external website which gives an auto-completing name form and deals with new members and different dues scenarios.

Also has a custom email templating engine which allows emails to be sent periodically with what points each member has earned to allow for easier point management.
